Perfect for reluctant readers and fans of Tom Fletcher, Pamela Butchart and Humza Arshad's Badman.\n\nThere's hardly anything that Sam Wu is afraid of. Unless you count ghosts, sharks, the dark and maybe even spiders. But definitely NOT zombies. Except for actual real ones maybe.\n\nSo when Sam's arch nemesis, Ralph Zinkerman the Third announces that he has zombie werewolves living in his basement, for the first time ever, Sam really isn't sure if he wants to be the one to save the day. Ralph has always been pretty mean to him and, well, just one little nibble from the zombie werewolves wouldn't hurt that much, would it?\n\nCommon childhood fears dealt with in a hilarious, sensitive and accessible way.\n\nAlso by Katie and Kevin Tsang:\nSam Wu is NOT Afraid of Ghosts 9781405287517\nSam Wu is NOT Afraid of Sharks 9781405287524\nSam Wu is NOT Afraid of the Dark 9781405287531\nSam W is NOT Afraid of Spiders 9781405294287\n\n\nKatie and Kevin Tsang met in in 2008 while studying at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Since then they have lived on three different continents and travelled to over 40 countries together. They currently live in London.\n\nKevin was born in Copenhagen and grew up in Atlanta, Georgia. Some of Sam Wu's experiences are based on Kevin's childhood (he's feeling much more confident now). Katie was born and raised in Southern California. She has previously worked at Booktrust, the UK's largest children's reading charity, and also writes YA fiction as Katherine Webber.","reviews":"","subject":"Humorous stories (Children's / Teenage), Animal stories (Children's / Teenage), School stories (Children's / Teenage), Family & home stories (Children's / Teenage), Coping with anxiety & phobias, Personal & social issues: racism & multiculturalism (Children's / Teenage), JUVENILE FICTION / Humorous Stories, JUVENILE FICTION / Action & Adventure / General, JUVENILE FICTION / Social Themes / Friendship, Childrens stories, (C) 7-9 years; (3) Fiction; (N) Ordinary Printed Book Format; (7) Non-character; (9) Non Tie-in, Fiction 7+, Humorous Stories, Developing Reader","series":null,"series_number":null,"pub_date":"Jan 09, 2020","pub_date_iso":"20200109","page_count":null,"usd_price":null,"gbp_price":"5.99","format":"Paperback"},{"title":"Winnie-the-Pooh: The Goodnight Collection","isbn":"9781405294393","amz_uk_url":"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1405294396","amz_us_url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1405294396","amz_ca_url":"http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1405294396","amz_de_url":"http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/1405294396","amz_br_url":"http://www.amazon.com.br/gp/product/1405294396","amz_mx_url":"http://www.amazon.com.mx/gp/product/1405294396","amz_fr_url":"http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/1405294396","amz_es_url":"http://www.amazon.es/gp/product/1405294396","amz_jp_url":"http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/1405294396","amz_in_url":"http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/1405294396","kobo_url":"https://store.kobobooks.com/search?Query=9781405294393","infini-beam_url":"http://www.infibeam.com/search?q=9781405294393","google_play_url":"https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9781405294393","hive_url":"http://www.hive.co.uk/Search/Keyword?keyword=9781405294393&productType=0","booktopia_url":"http://www.booktopia.com.au/search.ep?keywords=9781405294393&productType=917504","barnes_and_noble_url":"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/9781405294393","worldcat_url":"http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9781405294393","books_a_million_url":"http://www.booksamillion.com/search?query=9781405294393&where=All","book_finder_url":"http://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=&title=&lang=en&isbn=9781405294393&new=1&used=1&ebooks=1&mode=basic&st=sr&ac=qr","wordery_url":"https://wordery.com/search?term=9781405294393","waterstones_url":"https://www.waterstones.com/index/search/?term=9781405294393","foyles_url":"http://www.foyles.co.uk/all?term=9781405294393","book_depository_url":"http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9781405294393","wh_smith_url":"http://www.whsmith.co.uk/search/go?af=&w=9781405294393","blackwells_url":"http://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/jsp/welcome.jsp?action=search&type=isbn&term=9781405294393","oxfam_url":"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/search-results?q=9781405294393;show_all=ogb_mixed","subtitle":"Bedtime Stories for Sleepy Heads","image_path":"9781405294393.jpg","author":"A.

Perfect for fans of Jacqueline Wilson's Tracey Beaker, Cathy Cassidy, Pax and Gill Lewis.\n\n\nWhen eleven-year-old Addie goes to stay with a foster-care family on a remote Exmoor farm in the midst of a very cold winter, she is full of hurt, anger and a deep mistrust of everyone around her. Until one day, when she rescues a tiny wild foal from the moorland snow and Addie discovers that perhaps she's not so alone after all.\n\nAnd as adventure and unexpected friendship blossom, Addie is determined that both of them will know what is to be home again soon . . .\n\n\nSusanna Bailey divides her time between writing, freelance social-work, and lecturing in Creative Writing at Bath Spa University, where she also studied. Susanna wrote Snow Foal during her time at the same university where she drew much inspiration from her tutor, award-winning David Almond. Snow Foal has already been shortlisted for the Joan Aitken Future Classics Prize.","reviews":"","subject":"Animal stories (Children's / Teenage), Family & home stories (Children's / Teenage), School stories (Children's / Teenage), JUVENILE FICTION / Family / Orphans & Foster Homes, JUVENILE FICTION / Animals / Horses, JUVENILE FICTION / Family / Siblings, JUVENILE FICTION / Holidays & Celebrations / Christmas & Advent, JUVENILE FICTION / Social Themes / Emotions & Feelings, JUVENILE FICTION / Social Themes / Friendship, Childrens stories, (D) 9-11 years; (3) Fiction; (N) Ordinary Printed Book Format; (7) Non-character; (9) Non Tie-in, Children's Fiction, Fiction 9+, Animal Stories, Children's / Teenage fiction: Family & home stories, Children's / Teenage fiction: Nature & animal stories, Children's / Teenage fiction: School stories, Children's / Teenage fiction: General fiction","series":null,"series_number":null,"pub_date":"Nov 14, 2019","pub_date_iso":"20191114","page_count":null,"usd_price":null,"gbp_price":"6.99","format":"Paperback"},{"title":"Star Wars: Joke Book (NEW)","isbn":"9781405292894","amz_uk_url":"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/140529289X","amz_us_url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/140529289X","amz_ca_url":"http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/140529289X","amz_de_url":"http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/140529289X","amz_br_url":"http://www.amazon.com.br/gp/product/140529289X","amz_mx_url":"http://www.amazon.com.mx/gp/product/140529289X","amz_fr_url":"http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/140529289X","amz_es_url":"http://www.amazon.es/gp/product/140529289X","amz_jp_url":"http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/140529289X","amz_in_url":"http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/140529289X","kobo_url":"https://store.kobobooks.com/search?Query=9781405292894","infini-beam_url":"http://www.infibeam.com/search?q=9781405292894","google_play_url":"https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9781405292894","hive_url":"http://www.hive.co.uk/Search/Keyword?keyword=9781405292894&productType=0","booktopia_url":"http://www.booktopia.com.au/search.ep?keywords=9781405292894&productType=917504","barnes_and_noble_url":"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/9781405292894","worldcat_url":"http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9781405292894","books_a_million_url":"http://www.booksamillion.com/search?query=9781405292894&where=All","book_finder_url":"http://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=&title=&lang=en&isbn=9781405292894&new=1&used=1&ebooks=1&mode=basic&st=sr&ac=qr","wordery_url":"https://wordery.com/search?term=9781405292894","waterstones_url":"https://www.waterstones.com/index/search/?term=9781405292894","foyles_url":"http://www.foyles.co.uk/all?term=9781405292894","book_depository_url":"http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9781405292894","wh_smith_url":"http://www.whsmith.co.uk/search/go?af=&w=9781405292894","blackwells_url":"http://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/jsp/welcome.jsp?action=search&type=isbn&term=9781405292894","oxfam_url":"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/search-results?q=9781405292894;show_all=ogb_mixed","subtitle":"","image_path":"9781405292894.jpg","author":"Egmont Publishing UK","blurb":"<b>  Why can't you get rid of BB-8?
